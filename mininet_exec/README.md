# Execute Arbitrary Programs In Mininet Hosts With mininet_exec

This is a script that executes arbitrary programs within two
[mininet](http://mininet.org/) hosts. It uses the simplest possible
mininet topology with a single switch connected to two hosts. We refer
to the first host as the `server` and the second one as the `client`.

The main use case of this script is to serve as a testbed for data
synchronization algorithms.

``` shell
$ ./mininet_exec.py --help
usage: mininet_exec.py [-h] [-l LATENCY] [-b BANDWIDTH] [-pl PACKET_LOSS]
                       [-cpus CPU_SERVER] [-cpuc CPU_CLIENT] [--ping-iperf]
                       SERVER_SCRIPT CLIENT_SCRIPT

Runs arbitrary programs within mininet nodes in a single-switch-two-nodes topology.
Network parameters and the computational power of nodes are adjustable.

positional arguments:
  SERVER_SCRIPT         The script that runs within the server (server node IP is 192.168.1.1, host name h1).
  CLIENT_SCRIPT         The script that runs within the client (client node IP is 192.168.1.2, host name h2).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LATENCY, --latency LATENCY
                        Latency on each node to switch link (in ms).
  -b BANDWIDTH, --bandwidth BANDWIDTH
                        Bandwidth on each node to switch link (in Mbps).
  -pl PACKET_LOSS, --packet-loss PACKET_LOSS
                        Packet loss on each node to switch link (in percentages, e.g., 10).
  -cpus CPU_SERVER, --cpu-server CPU_SERVER
                        CPU share of the server (in percentages, e.g., 33).
  -cpuc CPU_CLIENT, --cpu-client CPU_CLIENT
                        CPU share of the client (in percentages, e.g., 33).
  --ping-iperf          If passed, ping and iperf tests between server and client are run before running the scripts.
```

## A minimal example
Don't forget to install mininet in your environment:

``` shell
pip install requirements.txt
```

You need to run `mininet_exe` as root (just like the basic mininet):

``` shell
sudo ~/.virtualenvs/my_env/bin/python mininet_exec.py \
    --latency 5                                       \
    --bandwidth 50                                    \
    --packet-loss 2                                   \
    --cpu-server 20 --cpu-client 30                   \
    --ping-iperf                                      \
    "./doc/test.sh server" "./doc/test.sh"
```

The output contains the mininet logs:

``` shell

```

It also prints the exact commands that are run on the hosts. Both the
`stdout` and `stderr` from the hosts are redirected to
`server_UID.mnlog` and ``client_UID.mnlog`` in the current working
directory.

## How to set parameters?
Think of the network as a single channel and set the channel
parameters. Use `--ping-iperf` option and observe the outputs of
`ping` and `iperf`.

- When you set latency of, e.g., 10 ms, then client-switch link will
  have latency of 5 ms, and the switch-server link will also have 5 ms
  latency. However, `ping` will measure ~20 ms because it measures
  RTT.
- When you set bandwidth of, e.g., 50 Mbps, that will be roughly the
  server-client throughput.
- When you set packet loss to 2%, then client-switch link has 1%
  packet loss, and switch-server also has 1% packet loss. That is,
  `--packet-loss`/2 = client-switch packet loss = switch-server packet
  loss.

Notes:
- Package loss has a big impact on throughput. For example, with
  `--bandwidth 50` and `--packet-loss 0`, the throughput will be close
  to 50 Mbps. However, with 2% packet loss, throughput will drop to
  ~10 Mbps.

## A CPISync example
[doc/CPISync](doc/CPISync) has a precompiled executable of the CPISync
benchmark runner as well as the example `*_param_data.cpisync` files
that the benchmark runner requires. An example of benchmark runner
usage is given in [doc/cpisync_test.sh](doc/cpisync_test.sh). CPISync
benchmarks can be run within `mininet_exec` as follows:

``` shell
sudo ~/.virtualenvs/my_env/bin/python mininet_exec.py \
    --latency 5                                       \
    --bandwidth 50                                    \
    --packet-loss 2                                   \
    --cpu-server 20 --cpu-client 30                   \
    "./doc/cpisync_test.sh server" "./doc/cpisync_test.sh"
```
